	<h2>Loud Music: A Silent Killer</h2>

	<p>You probably have listened to loud music at some point, and that's not uncommon. But, blasting music in your ears with the new EarPods, or some headphones is actually damaging to your ability to hear clearly, and research shows more and more people are experiencing this issue. It's not just loud music from earphones or headphones, the list of hearing damaging sounds goes all the way to planes, instruments, lawnmowers and jackhammers. As a rule of thumb, anything loud damages your ears. Why? Let's see.</p>

	<p>Humans are born with about 16,000 hair cells in the ear, which naturally decreases in number as they grow older. These hairs are what receive and transmit the sound information to our brain. A group of researchers carried out specialized hearing tests on 123 people aged between 18-27. They found hair cells in the cochlea, a spiral-shaped tube in the inner ear which helps in sound detection, functioned less efficiently in people who were exposed to the highest levels of recreational noise from venues such as clubs and concerts.</p>

	<p>All this means hearing loss, or, deafness. Being deaf not not fun, even with hearing aids. Being deaf also brings potential danger to your life. Imagine walking across the road as a car frantically beeps their horn at you. Being deaf does not help with communication. Without the clarity of normal hearing, you end up only hearing globs of unintelligible chatter. Not fun.</p>

	<p>You still want to listen to music? Go to concerts? To protect your hearing, you can do many things. While listening to music, instead of using earphones or headphones, use the inbuilt speaker at a low level. Make sure to not listen to music for extended periods, and don't go around sticking your head in drums. At a concert, you might want a to invest in a few specially designed ear plugs made for concerts. Take these steps (and more) and you won't go around saying "What?" later on.</p>
