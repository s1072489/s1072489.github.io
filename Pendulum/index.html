        <i>To investigate the effects of the length of string on the period of 10 oscillations with a Retort Stand + String setup.</i>

    <article class="Hypothesis">
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <i>My hypothesis is that the shorter the string is, the quicker the pendulum would swing and finish swinging due to the smaller distance the ball would need to travel.</i>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Change length of string and measure length (short/medium/long).</li>
            <li>Hold ball stretched from string at a 90Â° angle.</li>
            <li>Start stopwatch and let go of the ball simultaneously without pushing the ball downwards.</li>
            <li>Record the time taken for 10 oscillations.</li>
            <li>Repeat Step 3 and 4 twice more.</li>

        <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>How does the length of the pendulum affect its period?</b></li>
            <i>The effect of the length of string was that the shorter the string was, the shorter the oscillations were.</i>
            <li><b>Why is it a good idea to measure the time for 10 swings rather than just one?</b></li>
            <i>Measuring 10 swings was a good idea so the time could be more evened out, rather than just the original swing.</i>
            <li><b>What variables must be kept constant when determining the effect of a push/mass/length on the period of a pendulum?</b></li>
            <i>The weight of the ball and the angle the ball was get go from had to be controlled.</i>
            <li><b>In your experiment, what was the;</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Independent variable?</b></li>
                    <i>The length of string used</i>
                    <li><b>Dependent variable?</b></li>
                    <i>The time taken for 10 swings</i>
                </ul>
            <li><b>In this experiment, you were required to repeat each measurement three times. When you do this, the time taken for 10 swings is not always the same.</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Suggest two or more reasons for this.</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>The measurements were for 10 swings because it would reduce the effects human error would on the measurement.</i></li>
                        <li><i>One swing would vary across tests, but 10 swings would be more evened out.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Suggest why the differences between measurements are usually greater for shorter pendulums.</b></li>
                    <i>I believe the reason that measurements for shorter lengths of string would fluctuate is that human imperfection would have more of an impact of the result.</i>
